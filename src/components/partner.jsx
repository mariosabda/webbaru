            Of course, I am not alone in working on this website; I also have a dedicated support system that faithfully accompanies me in working on this project.

            I also don’t learn alone; I’m assisted by my older brother, <a href="https://rifqifarhansyah.id/" className="hover:text-[#FF204E] font-bold">Mohammad Rifqi Farhansyah</a>, 
            who is my personal tutor in programming (coding).
